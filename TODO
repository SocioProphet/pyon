Current pyon TODO list:
=======================

PACKAGING/CODE:

- Automate versioning and packaging of pyon egg
- More __str__() output for classes
- Clear distinction between ION process and pyon process
- Move directory and datastore code to coi_services if possible
- Use log.info for relevant output, debug for debug level
- Rename EndpointFactory -> Endpoint and Endpoint -> Conversation
- More consistent and fewer packages

CONTAINER/STARTUP:

- Enhanced shell API
- Enhanced messaging bookkeeping: ms() more telling
- Exchange spaces introduced
- Add event framework
- Check service implementation against service definition (parameters, order)
- Error handling improved
- Fail quick on startup
- Standard entry point for ?
- DualModifierDict for two overrides in order (reference not copy the first one)

OBJECTS:

- Second look at service YML files (look at WSDL). Methods -> operations, maybe no objects
- Service default arguments set to {} and [] in base class. Dangerous Python idiom. Solutions?

PROCESS/SERVICE:

- Clear confusion with service vs process
- Unique process ID
- Process as instance aggregating one state and multiple endpoints
- Process (greenlet) accepts messages from endpoints. One greenlet per process; one message at a time.
- Process ioloop (picking messages and activating on schedule)
- Process attachment (direct or via container)
- IDE code completion for service clients and methods
- Be able to start non-service process in container
- Optional vs. mandatory service arguments
- Validate object content vs. service operations
- Infinite and recurring processes (in on_start)
- Do not create message processing worker thread in BinderListener by default (use the process ioloop)

MESSAGING:

- Use ACKs
- Messaging properties set:
- Non-AMQP (ZeroMQ)
- Local messaging with greenlet handover

TESTING:

- Switch to nosetests
- Log and print in tests: visible on run

OPEN QUESTIONS:
- How to declare mandatory (non null) service parameters?
- Should we support kwargs in service clients?
- How to start stream processes?

BUGS (see also Jira project CISWCORE)

- Source path from not the current repo (e.g. pyon/examples not found)
- Find result does not pass validate interceptor
- Check IonObject validation vs. extends (does it work?)
- DictModifier str() does not print full merge
