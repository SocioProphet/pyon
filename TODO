Current pyon TODO list:
=======================

PACKAGING:

- Remove all unnecessary imports from setup.py
- Automate versioning and packaging of pyon egg
- Use buildbot

CODE:

- Enforce naming conventions for generated interface dirs
- More str() output
- Clear distinction between ION process and pyon process
- Clear confusion with service vs process
- Move all services out of pyon

STARTUP

- Enable to start more than one CC out of the same directory (logging, pid file)
- Enable other packages to import pyon and run it from their directory
- Process spawnargs
- Assertion of execution environment. Proper exit and message if false

OBJECTS:

- Revise service YML files (look at WSDL)

CONTAINER:

- Enhanced shell API
- Enhanced messaging bookkeeping
- Shutdown
- Add event framework
- Apply command line config to app/rel config

TESTING:

- Work with pypi mock (in particular specs)
- Have an IonTest base class

PROCESS:

- Unique process IO
- Process attachment (direct or via container)
- Lifecycle

MESSAGING:

- Use AMQP headers

TERMINOLOGY:

- Node ~ AMQP connection
  - Variants: blocking, non-blocking
- Channel ~ AMQP channel + more
- Socket: abstracts a Channel
- Endpoint ~ AMQP publisher/consumer + conversation

BUGS:

- control_cc induced stop does not work
- Remove PID file even in case of abnormal termination
