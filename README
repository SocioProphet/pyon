Prototypes for ioncore-python in R2.

You need the following installed before you can use ioncore R2:
  - python 2.7
  - virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper modules for your python 2.7 installation
  - libevent 2.0
    - This can easily be installed with Homebrew on a Mac or a package manager on linux.
  - libyaml 3.0
    - You need the -dev or -devel version on linux. If you don't have such a package, use extern/setup-libyaml.sh.
    - The Homebrew version on a mac is sufficient.
  - zeromq 2.1.x
    - The Homebrew version on a mac is sufficient.
Short version to setup a mac (assumes python 2.7 is already setup):
  brew install libevent libyaml zeromq

Now setup a virtualenv with a command like the following (substitute your own name for "ion27"):
    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages --python=python2.7 ion27
    workon ion27

Next install the python package dependencies with:
    python setup.py install
